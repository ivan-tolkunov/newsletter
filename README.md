# It is a website to manage email newsletter.

It have 2 parts:
+ The landing page allows the user to sign up with their email address
+ The back office (protected with login/password):
+ Shows the list of user emails who signed
+ Has a page where I can type the content of the email and it will send it to everyone on the list
+ Implemented with Spring Boot

It easy to customize the website (i.e. change title, landing page copy, etc.) for somewhat technical people (e.g. via editing a config file).
