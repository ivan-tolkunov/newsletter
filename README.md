# It is a website to manage email newsletter.

It have 2 parts:
+ The landing page allows the user to sign up with their email address
+ The back office (protected with login/password):
+ Shows the list of user emails who signed
+ Has a page where I can type the content of the email and it will send it to everyone on the list

It easy to customize the website (i.e. change title, landing page copy, etc.) for somewhat technical people (e.g. via editing a config file).
